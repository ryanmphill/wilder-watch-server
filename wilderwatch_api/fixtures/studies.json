            "subject": "Monarch Butterfly",
            "summary": "Monarch migration is one of nature's greatest wonders. Near summer's end, these gorgeous butterflies begin to migrate from breeding habitat in Ontario to their overwintering grounds in Mexico. This southbound migration is completed by a single monarch generation, called the 'supergeneration', who travel approximately 3000 km from Ontario to Mexico.",
            "details": "In Ontario, we still need to know more about the migratory routes and habits of monarchs. We need your assistance to collect information about migratory monarchs! Your observations will be used to develop scientific models to help predict the locations of monarch fly-ways and where roosts occur throughout Ontario. Knowledge of the migratory routes and roosting habits of monarchs will help us direct resources to aid this at-risk species. In other words, you're contributing to a critical research project and your efforts will aid in conservation and restoration efforts to help migratory monarchs! If you observe a Monarch roost, remember to add it to this project!",

            "subject": "River Otter",
            "summary": "River otters were eliminated from the Smokies by the early 1900s due to habitat destruction and uncontrolled trapping for their valuable fur. In 1986, the National Park Service began a reintroduction program, and over the course of 8 years, 137 otters from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana were trapped and released into various drainages in the Smoky Mountains. Initial monitoring efforts showed that the otters took well to their new homes, but no long-term monitoring program was established.",
            "details": "The otters have quietly lived and reproduced here, protected from trapping and slowly filling their niche as top predators in our mountain streams. Today they are believed to be present in every drainage of the Smokies, but we don't know how many there are or how they are distributed. That's where we come in! As you're out enjoying the Smokies, post your observations of otters or otter signs (scat and tracks) on our Otter Spotter project page using WilderWatch. If you're not sure what you saw, be sure to 'request ID help.' If you saw an otter but weren't able to snap a photo, no worries! You can still post an observation describing what you saw. Be sure to indicate an accurate location on the observation map. If you found otter scat or tracks, post a photo!",

We have put recorders in places where frogs were historically detected and new places where we might expect to find them. Now we need your eyes to help us in this detective work!",

Whether you explore solo, with friends and family, or colleagues and community groups, the data you collect will help track local bee diversity around the world.",

When you make an observation, you'll record: Who you are, what you saw, where you saw it, when you saw it, evidence of what you saw. Remember, you should make separate observations for each separate organism you encounter.",
